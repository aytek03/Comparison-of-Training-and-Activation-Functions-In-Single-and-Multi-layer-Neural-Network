# Neural-Network

This project has two parts. First part compares six BP training functions in single layer feedforward network and compares four activation functions in multi-layer feedforward network. Second part compares six BP training functions in single layer pattern recognition network and compares four activation functions in multi-layer pattern recognition network. In single layer feedforward network, trainlm shows a better performance whereas traingd and traingdm show a worse performance. trainlm is used for multi-layer feedforward network. In multi-layer feedforward network, logsig shows a better performance whereas purelin shows a worse performance. In single layer pattern recognition network, trainlm shows better performance while traingd shows a worse performance. trainlm is used for multi-layer pattern recognition network. In multi-layer pattern recognition network, tansig shows a better performance whereas hardlim shows a worse performance.
